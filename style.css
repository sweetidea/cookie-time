Style are enqueued directly from LESS files, using library/wp-less
------------------------------------------------------------------

To edit the styles, make changes to the files within /library/less

The one exception is the login stylesheet: This must be compiled as
CSS, and included in /library/css. This is because wp_enqueue_style
cannot be used to enqueue login stylesheets; these stylesheets must
be included as an echo'd <link> tag, and therefore any referenced
files must be regular CSS.

LESS was selected over SASS for the Sweet Idea theme due to the easy
integration of LESS into WordPress using the aforementioned wp-less
project: https://github.com/sanchothefat/wp-less

Need an introduction to pre-processors in general? Here are a few:
